\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The study of distributing resources amongst one or more receivers is an interdisciplinary field and is analysed from both a computational (how to find an allocation) and a qualitative (what a good allocation makes) standpoint~\cite{survey}.
Its areas of application are manifold:
industrial procurement, where the preferences of buyers and sellers need be appropriately captured and real-world constraints on goods and services be taken into account~\cite{survey};
mobile edge computing, where computation and storage are taken on by physically close cloud systems but participation has to be incentivised~\cite{edge_computing_auction, edge_computing_report};
manufacturing processes, where tasks should be scheduled efficiently within and between many production sites and disturbances be quickly paid heed to~\cite{survey};
water management, where hostile countries must come to mutual agreements on the withdrawal from contested rivers~\cite{water_management}.

In this seminar paper, we focus on non-sharable and indivisible resources, so-called \emph{items}.
The receivers of those items are called \emph{agents}.
The distributions of items amongst agents are modelled through allocations:
\begin{definition}
	Let~\(\goods\) be a set of \(m\) items and~\(\agents\) be a set of \(n\) agents.
	An \emph{allocation} is a tuple \(\alloc[][] = (\alloc)_{i \in \agents}\) of \emph{bundles} \(\alloc \subset \goods\) such that each item is element of exactly one bundle, that is \(\mathop{\bigcup\hspace{-1pt}_{i \in \agents}} \alloc = \goods\) and \(\alloc \cap \alloc[][i'] = \emptyset\) for all \(i \neq i'\).
	An item~\(j \in \goods\) is \emph{assigned}\todo{or rather \enquote{allocated}?} to agent \(i \in \agents\) if \(j \in \alloc\) holds.
\end{definition}

The satisfaction of an agent \(i\) with her bundle \(\alloc\) is measured by her \emph{valuation function}~\(\valuations\), which assigns each set of items a value.
We always assume that valuation functions are non-negative, \ie, \(\valuations[\genericset] \ge 0\) \(\forall \genericset \subset \goods\), and monotonically non-decreasing, \ie, \(\valuations[\genericset[1]] \le \valuations[\genericset[2]]\) \(\forall \genericset[1] \subset \genericset[2] \subset \goods\).
In addition, the empty set is always valued at zero, \ie, \(\valuations[\emptyset] = 0\).
In a slight abuse of notation, we sometimes omit curly braces delimiting a set, so we write \(\valuations[j_1, j_2, \dots]\) but mean \(\valuations[\{j_1, j_2, \dots\}]\) for example.

In order to measure and maximise the overall satisfaction of all agents, one needs to combine their valuations.
Several options arise here;
common choices are the utilitarian social welfare, that is the sum of all valuations~\cite{inapproximability, survey, APNSWuSVþUM, water_management, edge_computing_auction}, and the egalitarian social welfare, that is the minimum of all valuations~\cite{survey, APNSWuSVþUM}.
We consider a third one, the Nash social welfare.
\begin{problem}
	Given a set \(\goods\) of items and a set \(\agents\) of agents with monotonically non-decreasing valuation functions \(\valuations \colon \powerset[\goods] \to \realposzero\) and agent weights \(\eta_i \in \realpos\) for all agents \(i \in \agents\), the \emph{Nash social welfare (\NSW) problem} is to find an allocation maximising the weighted geometric mean of valuations, that is,
	\begin{equation*}
		\argmax_{\alloc[][] \in \allallocs{\agents}{\goods}} \braces{ \NSW(\alloc[][]) }
		\quad\text{with~}
		\NSW(\alloc[][]) \coloneq \paren[\Big]{ \smashoperator{\prod_{i \in \agents}} \valuations[\alloc]^{\weight} }^{1 / \sum_{i \in \agents} \weight}
	\end{equation*}
	where \(\allallocs{\agents}{\goods}\) is the set of all possible allocations.
	The problem is called \emph{symmetric} if all agent weights \(\weight\) are equal, and \emph{asymmetric} otherwise.
\end{problem}

\Citeauthor{APNSWuSVþUM}~\cite{APNSWuSVþUM} consider five different types of non-negative monotonically non-decreasing valuation functions of which we are going to consider only the following two due to space constraints:
\begin{description}
	\item[Additive]
	The valuation \(\valuations[\genericset]\) of an agent \(i\) for a set \(\genericset \subset \goods\) of items \(j\) is the sum of individual valuations \(\valuations[j]\), that is, \(\valuations[\genericset] = \sum_{j \in \genericset} \valuations[j]\).

	\item[Submodular]
	Let \(\valuations[\genericset[1] \given \genericset[2]] \coloneq \valuations[\genericset[1] \cup \genericset[2]] - \valuations[\genericset[2]]\) denote the marginal valuation\todo{or rather utility?} of agent~\(i\) for a set \(\genericset[1] \subset \goods\) of items over a \emph{disjoint} set \(\genericset[2] \subset \goods\).
	This valuation functions satisfies the submodularity constraint \(\valuations[j \given \genericset[1] \cup \genericset[2]] \le \valuations[j \given \genericset[1]]\) for all agents \(i \in \agents\), items \(j \in \goods\) and sets \(\genericset[1], \genericset[2] \subset \goods\) of items.
	\todo[inline]{What is the motivation for submodular functions? [IRfCAwSUF]}
\end{description}
We use \emph{additive \NSW} and \emph{submodular \NSW} as shorthands for the Nash social welfare problems with additive and submodular valuation functions, respectively.
